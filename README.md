# Globald-deformation-of-Lie-algebra-E_7
### Abstract
This repository accompanies the mathematical paper Global deformation of Lie algebra $E_7$ in characteristic 2. where we provide full proofs and theoretical details for the results summarized here. The Lie algebra of type $\bar{E_7}$ in characteristic 2 has a nontrivial space of local deformations $H^2(L,L)$, isomorphic to the standard representation of the Chevalley group of type $E_7$. We explore the integrability of cocycles across four distinct orbits under the automorphism group’s action: **Singular**, **Luminous**, **Brilliant**, and a **parameterized family of Dark orbits**.
​
### Algorithmic Approach
To verify $\psi \cup \psi=0$, we employ a **Python program**, circumventing explicit computation of $H^{3}(L,L)$:

### Results
- *Singular orbit*: Integrability proven theoretically (see paper).
- *Luminous/Brilliant orbits*:  Integrability confirmed computationally.
- *Dark orbits*: Open for future work.
