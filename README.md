# Globald-deformation-of-Lie-algebra-E_7
Lie algebra of type \bar{E_7} in characterstic 2 hav a non trivial space of local deformation H²(L,L). The space H²(L,L) is isomorphic to the stadard representation of the Chevalley group of type E_7 which is the automorphism group of the lie algebra E_7 in characteristic 2. When two co-cycles belong to the same orbit by the action of automorphism group, they gives isomorphic deformation. The action has four orbits Singular, Luminous, Briliant and parametrized Dark orbits. For each orbit we choose a representative, then we prove his integrability. A suffisant condition for the integrabilité of co-cycles \psi is \psi \cup \psi =0. We use the programme in Python code which show that.


# Python code
Programme wich compute the co-cycles [\psi_1,\psi_2], [\psi_1,\psi_3] and [\psi_2,\psi_3].
