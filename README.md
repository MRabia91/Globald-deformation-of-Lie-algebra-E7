# Globald-deformation-of-Lie-algebra-E_7
### Abstract
The Lie algebra of type \bar{E_7} in characteristic 2 has a nontrivial space of local deformations H²(L,L). This cohomology space H²(L,L)  is isomorphic to the standard representation of the Chevalley group of type 
E_7 which coincides with the automorphism group of the Lie algebra \bar{E_7} in characteristic 2. When two cocycles belong to the same orbit under the action of the automorphism group, they produce isomorphic deformations. The group action partitions the space into four orbits: Singular, Luminous, Brilliant, and a family of parametrized Dark orbits. For each orbit, we select a representative cocycle and prove its integrability. A sufficient condition for the integrability of a cocycle \psi is the vanishing of its cup square, i.e., \psi \cup \psi =0. To verify this condition, we implement a computational check using a Python program, which confirms the vanishing result for all chosen representatives.
